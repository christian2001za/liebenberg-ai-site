# Vision 2026: Liebenberg AI Redesign Strategy

**Concept**: "Computational Elegance"
**Goal**: Transform from a "Service Provider" to an "Architect of Intelligence".
**Inspiration**: Linear, Wispr Flow, Anthropic, Teenage Engineering.

If I were to rebuild this from scratch for a "no-budget" premium look, here is exactly what I would do.

---

## 1. The Core Philosophy & Aesthetic
The current site is clean and friendly. The *new* site should be **authoritative, kinetic, and immersive**.

*   **The Vibe**: "Living Software". The website shouldn't feel like a static brochure; it should feel like a piece of high-end software itself.
*   **The Palette**:
    *   **Deep Charcoal / Midnight** (`#0A0A0B`) as the base. Dark mode signals "tech/power" more effectively for AI.
    *   **Subtle Grain**: A 2% noise texture overlay on everything to remove the digital "plasticky" feel.
    *   **Accent**: No more "primary colors". Use **Gradients of Light**. Use a soft, glowing "Sand" or "Platinum" gradient that moves when the user scrolls.

## 2. Structural Changes (The "How")

### A. The "Bento" Grid Hero
Start with a **Bento Grid** layout immediately in the hero.
*   **Block 1 (Large)**: The Value Prop. "Building the Operating System for your Business."
*   **Block 2 (Medium)**: A live, ticking counter of "Tasks Automating Right Now" (simulated or real).
*   **Block 3 (Small)**: A video loop of you (Christian) sketching a system.
*   **Block 4 (Small)**: The "Tech Stack" marquee running vertically.

### B. "Scrollytelling" Case Studies
Don't just list case studies. Make them a **Journey**.
*   As the user scrolls, the background color shifts slightly.
*   On the left: The "Before" (Chaos, piles of paper, slow animations).
*   On the right: The "After" (Streamlined lines, fast counters, clean UI).
*   **Interaction**: A slider the user can drag to see the efficiency gain.

### C. The "Playground"
A section where users can *feel* the AI.
*   A simple input box: "Paste a messy email here."
*   Output: real-time rewriting of that email into a structured JSON object or a polite response.
*   *Why?* Proven competence beats stated competence.

### D. Navigation
*   Move away from a top bar. Use a **Floating Dock** at the bottom center (macOS style) that expands on hover. It feels more "app-like" and modern.

## 3. Asset & Photography Requirements (The "Must Haves")

To achieve this premium look, generic photos must go. I need high-fidelity, purposeful photography.

### A. The "Architect" Shots (3-4 photos)
*   **Context**: You standing at a large glass wall or whiteboard covered in complex flowcharts/diagrams.
*   **Pose**: Back slightly to camera, pointing at a node, or profile view thinking.
*   **Lighting**: Cinematic, moody. Focus is on the *thinking process*, not just the smile.
*   **Wear**: Black turtleneck or very high-quality textured knitwear. Steve Jobs / Architect vibes.
*   **Why**: Establishes you as the *designer* of systems, not just a coder.

### B. The "Deep Work" Shots (2-3 photos)
*   **Context**: Low-angle shot of your hands on a premium mechanical keyboard, with code on the monitor blurring in the background.
*   **Context**: Over-the-shoulder shot looking at a sleek n8n workflow or complex Python script.
*   **Why**: Proves technical depth and craftsmanship.

### C. The "Human Connection" Shot (1-2 photos)
*   **Context**: You sitting across from a "client" (can be staged), pointing at a tablet/laptop screen, both looking engaged and enlightened.
*   **Why**: Shows you are safe to talk to. AI scares people; this photo removes the fear.

### D. Abstract Macro Shots (5-6 assets)
*   Don't use stock chips/brains.
*   Take macro photos of:
    *   Server lights blinking in the dark.
    *   Fiber optic cables.
    *   Close-up of a high-end camera lens or processor.
*   These serve as abstract textures for card backgrounds.

## 4. Technical Execution
*   **Framework**: Next.js 14 (App Router).
*   **Animation**: `framer-motion` for layout transitions. Everything must have an "entry" animation.
*   **3D**: `Three.js` / `React Three Fiber`. A subtle floating "neural network" mesh that reacts to the mouse in the background.
*   **Typography**: **Geist Sans** (Vercel's font) or **Satoshi** for that ultra-modern Swiss tech look.

**Summary**: The shift is from *telling* people "I do AI" to *showing* them "I live in the future, and I can take you there."
